        <p>The mission of the KoRT Leadership Development Program is to develop the leadership skills of potential and/or current officers of registered student organizations and to educate student leaders about OSI and university regulations and policies.</p>
        The main objective of KLDP is to increase the effectiveness of leadership within student organizations in order to maintain and foster positive growth of RSOs. In addition, the goal is to serve as ambassadors of positive public relations and service to Knights of the RoundTable.
